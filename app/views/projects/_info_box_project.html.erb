    </div>
<% elsif not @project.nil? and @project.ressources.count==0 then %>
    <div id='info_box'>

      <p>Create the resources - they are doing the work and are needed to calculate the budget based on hours * cost per hour !</p>

      <p>Your steps: New Project(OK) -> <%= link_to "New Resources", new_project_ressource_path(@project) %>  -> New Task ->  Estimate Baseline -> Track Project</p>


    </div>
<% elsif not @project.nil? and @project.tasks.count==0 %>
    <div id='info_box'>

      <p>Create a Tasks, it describes the work to be done by a specific resource. For tasks you can later request estimations from your team.</p>

      <p>Your steps: New Project(OK) -> New Resources(OK)  -> <%= link_to "New Task", new_project_task_path(@project) %> ->  Estimate Baseline -> Track Project</p>


    </div>

<% elsif  not @project.nil? and @project.tasks[0].baseline.nil? then %>
        <div id='info_box'>


        <p style="font-weight:bold"> Your project is ready to request the baseline estimation. This PERT estimation is used to determine your initial project budget. TRACKER will calculate the contingency according to your setting in the task.</p>

         <p>Your steps: New Project(OK) -> New Resources(OK)  -> New Task(OK) -> <%= link_to "Estimate Baseline", baseline_requests_path %> -> Track Project</p>

                    <p>Tip: With Tracker you can invite a new team-members via email to do the estimation: <%= link_to "Invite Team Members", users_path if current_user.is_pm? %>    </p>

<% elsif not @project.nil? and @project.tasks.count==1 and not @project.tasks[0].baseline.nil? and @project.tasks[0].estimations.count==0  %>

    <div id='info_box'>


       <p style="font-weight:bold">Now the Baseline-Budget was calculated - this budget you would request for your project. </p>
      <p> Your team would/will start working and you need to track the progress. Your request an estimation from your team and TRACKER will generate a precise budget forecast.</p>
